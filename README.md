# Project-Assignment-B
Final Hand in of Felix Wütherich, André Egeli and Henning Duwe

This is the final project of the course "Social Data Analysis and Visualization" hosted by the Technical University of Denmark.
The final goal was to create a website, which can be found here:

https://deepnote.com/@andr-egeli/Socialdata-045d9353-4964-400b-b33b-b595e8d707e0

The other code and data are the backbone of creating that website.
